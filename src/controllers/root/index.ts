      <p>
        Acme Inc needs to know how long a set of tasks is going to take their team to complete, and have those
        forecasts to be updated as tasks are completed. If a task is completed early, then that will move up the
        forecasted end date. If a task is completed late, then the forecast is going to be late.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team can only work on one task at a time, and must complete that task before moving onto the next one. Each
        task has a duration in days, so you can estimate when it will be completed as soon as the status changes to "In Progress".
        Once a task is "Complete", then the next task in the list moves to "In Progress" and the forecasted completion date
        is updated accordingly.
